## Run it?

### Dependencies:

The 3D LiDAR ROS Drivers depends on:
  - ros-master (tutorial [here](https://github.com/adamzr2000/unitree-go1-digital-twin/tree/main/digital-twin-service/ros-master))

### First you will need to build the container. 

In order to do that, run the following script:
```bash
./build.sh
```

### This will build the `3d-lidar` docker image. 

Verify that the image is present by running:
```bash
docker image ls
```

### Docker run example
In this folder we also provide a docker run example. 

> Note: ensure that the 3D LiDAR is connected via Ethernet to your PC before testing this container.

To run the 3D LiDAR ROS Drivers:
```bash
./run_example.sh
```

Verify that the container is up and running:
```bash
docker ps
```

In the output you should be able to see the `3d-lidar` container up and running.

Execute inside the container:
```bash
docker exec -it 3d-lidar /bin/bash

# 3d-lidar
roslaunch rslidar_sdk start.launch
```
